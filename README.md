# Efficency Comparison of our new package with other packages for fine-gray model


1. 'Efficency Comparison of our packages to other packages (time-independent covariates).R' is used to compare running time of 'cmprskHD' with other packages like 'glmnet', 'fastcmprsk' and 'crrp' for fine-gray model with time-independent covariates, which shows our package's  superiority.
2. 'Efficency Comparison of our packages to other packages (time-dependent covariates).R' is used to compare running time of 'cmprskHD' with other packages like 'glmnet'for fine-gray model with time-dependent covariates, which shows our package's  superiority.
3. If you want to run the two .R files in 2 and 3, please include all of the five .R files in the same R project.
